# Shoutcast-Management-Interface
This repo will be an updated copy of Shoutcast Management Interface. A forked version if you will that will support PHP 5.4+. A lot of the functions that the original software use were depreciated in PHP 5.4 which makes the program unusable. Additionally, I will attempt to focus on adding PDO transactions rather than using MySQLi.
